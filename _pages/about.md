Hello! I am a research assistant in the [Vision and Learning Lab](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), focusing on cross-modality learning such as audio-visual learning and vision-text learning.

My academic journey began in the Communication Engineering Department at National Taiwan University, where I pursued my M.S. degree under the guidance of Professor [Yuâ€‘Chiang Frank Wang](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/ycwang.html), specializing in Audio-Visual Learning. For my Master's thesis, I tackled the challenge of weakly-supervised Audio-Visual Video Parsing. My method involves leveraging large-scale contrastively pre-trained models to generate reliable pseudo labels, which outperformed existing methods in terms of effectiveness. Prior to my postgraduate studies, I obtained a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University.
